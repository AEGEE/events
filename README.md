# Events module
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AEGEE/oms-events.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.org/AEGEE/oms-events)


## Purpose

The event module shall implement everything related to basic events, giving a common ground for non-statutory events, statutory events and SUs.

## Get it running

I advise you to use the vagrant environment provided by [this](https://github.com/AEGEE/oms-development-vm) repo. "vagrant provision" and "vagrant up" should do everything you need, but for more details see the repo.

Setting up the events module seperately will not be supported, as it is (soon) relying on other services for user authentication and token management.

## Get active

If you want to develop another microservice or a frontend which uses this one, find the documentation of the API-Interface on [Apiary](http://docs.omsevents.apiary.io/#). 

More is explained in the readme of [oms-core](https://github.com/AEGEE/oms-core)

Also, any help is appreciated! Just contact Nico (AEGEE-Dresden) or Fabricio (AEGEE-Berlin) and check the instructions in the [oms-core](https://github.com/AEGEE/oms-core) repo.

## General

The event module shall implement everything related to basic events and their applications. Statutory events and SUs will be implemented in another microservices. Find the API documentation on [Apiary](http://docs.omsevents.apiary.io/#).

Also, any help is appreciated! Just contact Nico (AEGEE-Dresden, blacksph3re) and/or check the instructions in the [wiki](https://myaegee.atlassian.net/wiki/).

## Installation and running

There are 3 ways to run this microservice:

1. Using the [OMS Docker image](https://github.com/AEGEE/docker) - recommended
2. Using the Docker container
3. Running it inside the host system

### Using the OMS Docker image

This method will install the core, the events module and the databases for each service.
You can read the installation instructions on the [OMS Docker readme](https://github.com/AEGEE/docker).

### Using the Docker container

You will need to install and setup the core module, Docker and PostgreSQL database, modify the `config/index`,then run the following command:

```shell
cd /path/to/events # Replace it with your events folder
docker build . -t events # Building a Docker image
docker run -v /path/to/events:/usr/app/events --net=host events # Replace the folder name with your path to events folder
```

### Running it inside the host system

You will need to do the following steps:

* [Installing and setting up core module](https://myaegee.atlassian.net/wiki/display/OMSCORE/Installing+the+core)
* Installing and setting up Node.js and NPM (the Docker container uses the latest version)
* `cd /path/to/events` (replace the path with the path to events on your system)
* `npm install`
* (optional) Install `supervisord` to auto-restart process after crashes and file changes (`npm i -g supervisor`)
* Modify the `lib/config/configFile.json` (set up core URL, database URL etc.)
* Run it
  * Without supervisor: `node lib/server.js`
  * With supervisor: `supervisor lib/server.js`


### Configuring

You can specify the microservice configuration by editing the `lib/config.json` file. Check out the example at `lib/configFile.json.example` and the comments in `lib/config.js` for more information.

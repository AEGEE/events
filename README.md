#Events module

Until now I just copied the oms-core to have all the settings and a working base, I will remove all the oms-code from here and put my own in place.

Soon this shall be a microservice covering everything related to events and hopefully it will integrate nicely =)

A first draft of the API is available on [Apiary](http://docs.omsevents.apiary.io/#)
